In order to setup the aws cli, we need to download it from the documentation for windows or Linux or macOS.
1. After downloading it and setting it up with the gitpod from vs code, we initiate the gitpod by gp init and inorder to get it setup with a particular environment variable we check all the env variables taht are available.
--- env | grep current-folder-name
2. Now, in order to get working with your aws account setup from the terminal, we need to call in the command .
---aws sts get-caller-identity.
after this we need to give in the credentials to the gitpod terminal to get access to the aws .
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2, for setting uo the environment variables for above we need to setup a credential file.
