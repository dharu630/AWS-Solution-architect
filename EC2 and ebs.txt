the two concepts that are key to launching instanes
1. the amout of virtual hardware dedicated to the instance--instance 
2.software laoded on instance--AMI

The instance types are varied based on following parameters:
1. vcpus
2. memory
3. storage size and type
4. network performance-- ENHANCED NETWORKING BY ENABLING THE SINGLE ROOT i/O virtualization.

enhanced networking is only available for instances launched in the amazon virtual private cloud.
 here the ratio pf vcpus: memory = constant

INSTANCE TYPE FAMILIES:
C4 = COMPUTE OPTIMIZED
R3 = MEMORY OPTIMIZED
I2 = STORAGE OPTIMIZED 
G2 = GPU BASED INSTANCES

AMAZON MACHINE IMAGES defines teh software for the instance:
1. os and its config
2.initial state of any patches
3. application or system software

Four sources of AMI:
1. Published by AWS
2. AWS MarketPlace
3. Generated from existing instances
4. uPloaded virtual servers

Addressing an instance:1. Public DNS
 2. public Ip 3. Elastic Ip 4. additional methods like private ip address and elastic network addressing
Amazon ec2 uses the public key cryptography.

Virtual Firewall protection:
AWS allows you to control traffic in and out of your instances , those firewalls are called security groups.
EC2 -classic security group == controls only the outgoing traffic 
VPC- controls bith the outgoing and incomiogn traffic, every instance should have atleast one security group.

SECURITY GROUP RULES ATTRIBUTES:
1. PORT
2. PROTOCOL
3. SOURCE/DESTIANTION

LIFECYCLE OF INSTANCES
1. LAUNCHING--BOOTSTRAPPING[USERDATA]
2. VM-IMPORT/EXPORT
ISNTANCES  LAUNCHED within aws from AMIS cannot be exported.

3.Instance Metadata:
associated  security groups, instance ID, instance Type, AMI used to launch the instance
4. Managing instanes by tags
5. Mpnitoring instances
6. Modifying an instance-- instance type, security groups, for instances outside the amazon vpc like ec2 instances the security groups cannot be changed.

TERMINATION PROTECTION;
termination is protected from AWS calls, no prevention when triggered from OS, auto scaling groups.


PRICING OPTIONS:
1.on-demand instances 2. reservedinstances[ all upfront, partial upfront, no upfront] 3. Spot

Tenancy options:
1. sahred tenancy 2. dedicated insatnces 3. dedicated host

Placememnt groups: logical grouping of instances to lower the latency.
Instance stores: it provides temporary block level storage fro your isntance
